# The program:

This is the second capstone project for the HyperionDev Software Engineering bootcamp.
The program is a task manager that allows the user to:

* register a new user
* add a new task
* view all tasks
* view their personal assigned tasks
* change the due date of an incomplete task assigned to them
* change the user assigned to an incomplete task
* mark a task as complete
* generate two .txt reports showing statistics on users and tasks

# Capstone task requirements:

The task involved taking a starting code framework and adding functionality such as:

* preventing duplication of registered users
* displaying personal tasks with corresponding numbers
* the option to mark a task as complete, changing the relevant task dictionary value to True
* the option to edit the username assigned to an incomplete task
* the option to change the due date of incomplete task
* the ability to generate statistical .txt reports about tasks and users

It also required the code be made more modular through the use of functions and for possible
errors to be handled.

# Additional features:

Examples of additional changes, not required by the task:

* the option to toggle between detailed and summary displays of task lists
* code to check that task due dates provided by the user must >= the current day or later
